# CSS Algorithms

CSS algorithms are a-* namespaced classes that are named according to their CSS functionality, _not_ according to the interface element. Algorithms should be created for specific CSS grid layouts, CSS that makes use of custom properties for extendable patterns, or for CSS that provides styling that cannot be accomplished with larva-css utilities, e.g. CSS that requires pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.

Examples:

* a-border-before
* a-gradient-overlay
* a-top-stories-grid
* a-become-close-button
* a-show-on-hover
