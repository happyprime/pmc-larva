# One-off CSS

One-off CSS is styling cannot be added using normal Larva standards (utlities/algorithms classes in Twig or in prototype JS) due to lack of control of markup. For example, styling the markup from a plugin that does not provide access to the class attribute requires hand written CSS e.g. Swiftype (expandable search pattern).
